Hello! My name is Charles. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at {{< staticref "https://www.cc.gatech.edu/" "newtab" >}}Georgia Tech{{< /staticref >}} working with {{< staticref "https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/michael-best" "newtab" >}}Dr. Michael Best{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Irfan Essa{{< /staticref >}}. I'm fortunate to be a receipient of the {{< staticref "https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/" "newtab" >}}GEM Ph.D. fellowship{{< /staticref >}}. 
 
My research focuses on human-centered natural language processing for healthcare and multilingual AI systems in low-resource contexts.
My work involves developing tools to evaluate and improve the safety, robustness, and cultural adaptability of large language models. Iâ€™m motivated by a broader interest in addressing societal challenges through AI, building systems that are fair, safe, and inclusive across languages and cultures.

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from the {{< staticref "https://www.cs.utexas.edu/" "newtab" >}}University of Texas at Austin{{< /staticref >}}, where I worked with {{< staticref "https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Ying Ding{{< /staticref >}} in the AI Health Lab. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at {{< staticref "https://egr.vcu.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/" "newtab" >}}Virginia Commonwealth University{{< /staticref >}}.

Outside of research, I enjoy filming with my camera, traveling, spending time outdoors, and watching or playing sports.
